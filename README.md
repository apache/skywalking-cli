Apache SkyWalking CLI
===============

<img src="http://skywalking.apache.org/assets/logo.svg" alt="Sky Walking logo" height="90px" align="right" />

The CLI (Command Line Interface) for [Apache SkyWalking](https://github.com/apache/skywalking).

SkyWalking CLI is a command interaction tool for the SkyWalking user or OPS team, as an alternative besides using browser GUI.
It is based on SkyWalking [GraphQL query protocol](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-query-protocol), same as GUI.

# Install
As SkyWalking CLI is using `Makefile`, compiling the project is as easy as executing a command in the root directory of the project.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/apache/skywalking-cli
cd skywalking-cli
make clean && make
```

and copy the `./bin/swctl` to your `PATH` directory, usually `/usr/bin/` or `/usr/local/bin`, or you can copy it to any directory you like,
and add that directory to `PATH`.

# Commands
Commands in SkyWalking CLI are organized into two levels, in the form of `swctl --option <level1> --option <level2> --option`,
there're options in each level, which should follow right after the corresponding command, take the following command as example:

```shell
$ swctl --debug service list --start="2019-11-11" --end="2019-11-12"
```

where `--debug` is is an option of `swctl`, and since the `swctl` is a top-level command, `--debug` is also called global option,
and `--start` is an option of the third level command `list`, there is no option for the second level command `service`.

Generally, the second level commands are entity related, there're entities like `service`, `service instance`, `metrics` in SkyWalking,
and we have corresponding sub-command like `service`; the third level commands are operations on the entities, such as `list` command
will list all the `service`s, `service instance`s, etc.

## All available commands
This section covers all the available commands in SkyWalking CLI and their usages

### `service` sub-command
`service` sub-command (second level command) is an entry for all operations related to services, and it also has some sub-commands.

#### `service list [--start=<start time>] [--end=<end time>]`
`service list` lists all the services in the time range of \[`start`, `end`\].
`--start` and `--end` are both optional, and their default values follow the rules below:

- when `start` and `end` are both absent, `start = now - 30 minutes` and `end = now`, namely past 30 minutes;
- when `start` and `end` are both present, they are aligned to same precision by **truncating the more precise one**,
e.g. if `start = 2019-01-01 1234, end = 2019-01-01 18`, then `start` is truncated (because it's more precise) to `2019-01-01 12`,
and `end = 2019-01-01 18`;
- when `start` is absent and `end` is present, will determine the precision of `end` and then use the precision to calculate `start` (minus 30 units),
e.g. `end = 2019-11-09 1234`, the precision is `MINUTE`, so `start = end - 30 minutes = 2019-11-09 1204`,
and if `end = 2019-11-09 12`, the precision is `HOUR`, so `start = end - 30HOUR = 2019-11-08 06`;
- when `start` is present and `end` is absent, will determine the precision of `start` and then use the precision to calculate `end` (plus 30 units),
e.g. `start = 2019-11-09 1204`, the precision is `MINUTE`, so `end = start + 30 minutes = 2019-11-09 1234`,
and if `start = 2019-11-08 06`, the precision is `HOUR`, so `end = start + 30HOUR = 2019-11-09 12`;
